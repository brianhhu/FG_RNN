% CALC_HYSTERESIS: returns the thresholded matrix (if HYST is equal to 1) according
% to the hysteresis-method. The parameters used are THIGH and TLOW. Before hysteresis 
% thresholding is (possibly) applied the values of the matrix are scaled between 0 and 1, 
% so the parameters of TLOW and THIGH should also be between 0 and 1.
% A progressbar of the calculations is also shown.
%   CALC_HYSTERESIS(MATRIX, HYST, TLOW, THIGH) calculates the
%   hysteresis-thresholded image acoording to the following parameters
%     MATRIX - the matrix which should be thresholded
%     HYST - if this value is equal to 1, hysteresis thresholding is applied, otherwise 
%            the original matrix (scaled between 0 and 1) is returned
%     TLOW - lower bound for the thresholding (between 0 and 1)
%     THIGH - higher bound for the thresholding (between 0 and 1)

% scale the values in the range [0..1]
